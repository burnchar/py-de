py-de (pronounced Pie dee ee) is an extremely simple IDE written in python. The goal is ease of use - you can compile and link source code in a directory written in a variety of languages (C, C++, fortran, python, perl, ruby). The interface is similar to gedit, nedit, except that it has an execute function built right in so that users can compile code without even looking at the command line.  It would be a terrible IDE to use for real projects, but its perfect for beginning programmers.
